  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project was completed as my <strong>Final Year Project during my Mechanical Engineering degree</strong>.
      It investigates whether the mechanical complexity of a helicopter swashplate can be replaced
      with an entirely electronic cyclic control system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of using servos and linkages to vary blade pitch, this UAV generates cyclic control
      by rapidly modulating motor torque in synchronisation with rotor position. This produces
      directional lift through passive blade hinges, achieving pitch and roll authority without
      a swashplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept builds directly on academic work from the University of Pennsylvania,
      particularly research by James Paulos under Prof. Mark Yim, which demonstrated that
      underactuated rotors with passive hinges can be controlled using a single motor.

  <!-- CORE IDEA -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Core Idea: Electronic Cyclic Control</h2>
    <p>
      In a conventional helicopter, cyclic pitch is achieved mechanically by tilting a swashplate.
      In this UAV, cyclic control is generated electronically by synchronising motor torque
      with rotor position.
    </p>
    <p>
      A magnetic encoder mounted beneath the motor shaft provides absolute angular position.
      This allows the motor torque to be modulated once per rotation using a sinusoidal control signal.
      The resulting lead–lag motion of the hinged blades produces a cyclic variation in blade pitch,
      generating directional lift without any moving control surfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Referenced Research & Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      A key academic reference for this work is the swashplate-less rotor research carried out
      at the University of Pennsylvania by James Paulos under the supervision of Prof. Mark Yim.
      Their work demonstrates how passive blade hinges and precise motor control can replace
      traditional cyclic mechanisms in micro air vehicles.

    <p>
      Additional inspiration came from independent experimentation in the maker community,
      particularly Tom Stanton’s YouTube work exploring virtual swashplates and speed-modulated
      rotor control using angled hinges. His demonstrations provided practical insight into
      real-world implementation challenges of swashplate-less flight.

  <!-- CONTROL SYSTEM -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Control System & Firmware</h2>
    <p>
      Initial attempts to integrate the system with a traditional flight controller
      proved impractical due to the unconventional control architecture.
      The final design uses the Teensy 4.0 as the primary flight controller,
      handling radio input, IMU fusion, PID stabilisation, encoder feedback,
      and motor control on a single microcontroller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firmware was adapted from the open-source <em>dRehmFlight</em> project,
      with significant modifications to support cyclic torque modulation.
      Pitch and roll commands are resolved into sinusoidal motor commands
      based on the real-time rotor angle.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STRUCTURAL DESIGN -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Mechanical Design & Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The airframe was designed for rapid iteration and manufactured primarily from 3D printed PLA,
      with a carbon fibre tail boom supporting the yaw rotor.
      Finite Element Analysis was performed on critical structural components
      to validate strength under worst-case thrust and moment loads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the lightweight construction, stresses remained well below material limits,
      even under conservative loading assumptions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TESTING -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Testing & Results</h2>
    <p>
      Extensive ground testing was carried out before flight attempts.
      This included encoder verification, IMU validation, PID response testing,
      thrust measurement, and slow-motion analysis of blade motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrust testing showed that the hinged rotor produces slightly reduced efficiency
      compared to a rigid propeller, likely due to non-optimal blade angles under constant RPM.
      Initial flight tests demonstrated controllability but highlighted sensitivity
      to hinge friction and mass balance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Key Disadvantage: Motor Speed Modulation</h2>
    <p>
      The primary disadvantage of a swashplate-less cyclic system is its reliance on
      <strong>continuous acceleration and deceleration of the main rotor motor within each
      revolution</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional helicopters that operate the main rotor at near-constant RPM,
      this approach requires high-bandwidth torque control to repeatedly speed up and slow down
      the motor in precise angular phases.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased electrical and thermal stress on the motor and ESC</li>
      <li>Reduced efficiency compared to constant-RPM operation</li>
      <li>Greater dependence on fast control loops and accurate rotor position sensing</li>
    </ul>
