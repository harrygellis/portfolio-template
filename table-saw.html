    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Starting when I was 13 this table saw was my first major woodworking project. My first real endeavor into 
      making things, it came from a want to build projects that would be significantly easier with a table saw for
      ripping and crosscutting wood. Using the motor and blade from a dewalt radial arm saw I developed and built
      blade raising mechanism, fence system, and overall table structure from scratch.

    <h2>Build Process</h2>
    <p>
      Ironically a usefull tool for building a tablesaw is a tablesaw. The initial saw I used for ripping and crosscutting material for later designs was merely a 
      circular saw bolted to a piece of mdf which I used to construct the fence and frame. I could then use that setup to finish the more complex handle operated blade
      height adjustment.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
      My first lesson in everything is takes longer and is more diffucult than you intialy expect. It gave me a huge appreciation for the precision and planning that is 
      nessacery to make things work.
